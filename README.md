# CMSC6950_Project
Course project for CMSC6950 Spring 2021

Software Package: eddy
eddy implements several methods for extracting kinematical information from astronomical observations of Doppler shifted molecular line emission in protoplanetary disks [1]. The package further implements methods to fit a first moment map that is a frequently used analysis in the study of protoplanetary disks, typically used to constrain the mass of the central star and extract geometrical properties.
